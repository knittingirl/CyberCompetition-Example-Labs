This machine is relatively simple to exploit once the user has started the run.sh script.

An nmap scan of the machine shows that an http website is present, which is worth closer examination:

```knittingirl@knittingirl-OptiPlex-7060:~/Desktop/Simple-Vulnerable-Boxes/Windows Webshell$ nmap 192.168.56.11

```

The website includes one box that accepts input from the user. A relatively small amout of experimentation with common web vulnerabilities should eventually lead a user to conclude that the underlying code includes a code injection vulnerability, which allows a user to inject arbitrary commands after the ping by separating them with an "&" symbol. This allows the user to read the flag file.

If you dig into the source code of the vulnerable website, present in the ping.php file, you can see that line 5 includes the "system" function running with user-provided input. This is the crux of the vulnerability, since this function's job is to run string inputs as shell commands. This is why we were able to simply chain in another command after the ping to get arbitrary code execution.
